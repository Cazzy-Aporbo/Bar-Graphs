## **Introduction**

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights through various bar graph visualizations. The visualizations aim to provide a clear understanding of the distribution and survival rates of passengers based on different attributes.

## **Visualizations**

### Age Distribution

![Age Distribution](age_distribution.png)

This bar graph displays the distribution of passengers' ages.

### Age Distribution by Gender

![Age Distribution by Gender](age_distribution_gender.png)

This visualization shows the age distribution segmented by gender.

### Survival Rates by Embarkation Point

![Survival by Embarkation Point](survival_embarked.png)

This chart illustrates survival rates based on passengers' embarkation points.

### Survival Rates by Embarkation Point and Gender

![Survival by Embarkation Point and Gender](survival_embarked_sex.png)

This graph combines embarkation points and gender to show survival rates.

### Survival Rates by Family Size

![Survival by Family Size](survival_family.png)

This bar graph depicts survival rates relative to family size.

### Survival Rates by Passenger Class

![Survival by Passenger Class](survival_pclass.png)

This chart presents survival rates across different passenger classes.

## **Feature Engineering Notebook**

The Jupyter Notebook `cazandra_aporbo_hw8_feature_engineering.ipynb` contains the feature engineering process applied to the dataset, detailing the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis.

## **Pivot Table Analysis**

The file `pivot_table.csv` includes a pivot table summarizing key statistics from the dataset, providing a comprehensive overview of the analyzed data.
